## <a name="RS">Research Summary</a>
I am interested in applying analytical and differential geometric techniques to solve problems in classical and quantum physics. Previous work has covered areas in:

* classical electrodynamics (linear, nonlinear, scattering)
* quantum electrodynamics (Casimir stresses, light-matter interaction)
* continuum mechanics (elasticity, fluid dynamics)
* General Relativity (gravitational waves, astrophysical jets, cosmology)

My published work has application to areas such as star formation; laser-plasma acceleration; quantum encryption; the genesis of astrophysical jets; and modelling the early Universe.

## <a name="TOOT">Tools of the Trade</a>
Exterior differential geometry is the natural mathematical language to discuss differential properties of tensor fields on spacetime and their relation to integrals over material domains. My work heavily exploits this calculus to elucidate problems in relativistic spacetime physics. There are numerous references for differential geometry and General Relativity, but the one that has had the most impact is:

* [An Introduction to Spinors and Geometry with Applications in Physics](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Spinors_and_Geometry.html?id=FzcbAQAAIAAJ)  
Ian M. Benn and Robin W. Tucker;  
Adam Hilger Ltd, Bristol (1987)

The main reason for this is that one of the authors (Robin W. Tucker) was my PhD supervisor; hence this book contains the majority of notation and conventions that permeate my own work. I would point to the following resource: 

* [A Primer on Exterior Differential Calculus](http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=1450-55840302085B)  
David A. Burton  
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 30 (2003), 85-162

which delivers an excellent pedagogical introduction to differential forms and their application in physics.
