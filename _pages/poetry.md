	Mathematicians often talk about the "<i>beauty</i> of mathematics". This project explores this statement through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_(artform)">erasure poetry</a>, with current mathematical texts* as the source material. I enjoy the process of writing poetry and the nature of an erasure poem, like a tricky word puzzle, appeals to me. <br>
	<br>
	My aim is to create one poem every fortnight and release it every other Wednesday. Hopefully you will enjoy the (amateur!) verse maybe learn a thing or two and, with luck, my poetry will improve over the weeks! If you feel inspired, have any comments or would just like to have a go yourself, then please do feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me via email</a> with your query or submission. Enjoy!<br>

			<blockquote>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">Linear algebra</a>: this branch of mathematics developed from trying to solve numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation">linear equations</a> all at once! The new objects used in this pursuit and examining the underlying structures at play led to this powerful and highly applicable field of mathematics. It is where most students first encounter the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)">matrix</a>, an object made of numbers but which does not behave like "normal" numbers. For example, the order in which we multiply two matrices together matters, as you may get different results depending on which way round you do it! (Compare this with multiplying two "normal" numbers where the order doesn't matter:  $2\times 3$ is the same as $3\times 2$).

Due to its short structure, they are a very handy style when creating erasure poems, so I am sure many more haikus will appear (have a go at one yourself!).<br>

					Note: no books were harmed in the making of this poem, thanks to the helpful use of an acetate sheet.

				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis">Real analysis</a>: a fundamental branch of mathematics where students take a peek behind the curtain to understand the theory behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">calculus</a>. The topic is introduced in the first year of the majority of mathematics degrees and contains the first "new" material encountered by undergraduate students (real analysis is not part of the standard A-level syllabus). Consequently, it is often considered a "difficult" subject and provides a challenge for most students.

			<p style="font-size:80%;">
			<blockquote>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry">Differential geometry</a>: this topic studies the geometry of curves and surfaces, and is not covered in all undergraduate degree schemes in the UK. Over the years, after various generalisations, it has grown into a large field with applications to many areas of mathematics, as well as to physics, such as the language used to describe Einstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_general_relativity">general theory of relativity</a>. The basic questions asked in an undergraduate course is how do we describe the "curve" (more precisely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>) of a curve? What about the curvature of a surface? Perhaps surprisingly, there is more than one way to describe how a surface is curved.
